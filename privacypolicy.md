# Privacy Policy for YT Auto Quality

**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025

## 1. Overview
"YT Auto Quality" is a browser extension designed to help users automatically set their preferred video resolution on YouTube. We value your privacy and have designed this extension to operate with the minimum amount of data required.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
* **No Personal Data:** This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or account credentials.
* **User Preferences:** We only save your selected video quality resolution (e.g., "1080p").
* **Local Storage:** Your quality preference is stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage.sync` API. This allows your settings to persist across your browser sessions without being sent to our servers.
* **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history, search queries, or video watch history.

## 3. Permissions Justification
To function correctly, the extension requires the following permissions:
* **`storage`**: Required to save and retrieve your preferred video quality setting.
* **Host Permissions (`youtube.com`/*)**: Required to detect when a video player is loaded and to programmatically adjust the quality using the YouTube Player API.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing
* **No Data Selling:** We do not sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties.
* **No External Servers:** The extension does not communicate with any external servers; all logic and data management stay within the Chrome browser environment.

## 5. Security
Because the extension does not collect sensitive data or transmit information over the internet, the risk to your privacy is minimal. We follow modern security standards for Manifest V3 to ensure code injection is handled safely.
